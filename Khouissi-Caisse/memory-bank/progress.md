## What Works

### Infrastructure & Setup
- [x] **Arabic Localization and RTL Support**:
  - Arabic resource files created
  - RTL flow direction configured
  - Arabic fonts set up
  - Western digits (0-9) for numerical values configured

### Authentication System
- [x] **User Authentication**:
  - User service interface created
  - Mock user service implemented
  - Login view with Arabic UI developed
  - Password security handling implemented
  - Simplified login UI (removed Remember Me option and loading indicator)

### Core Application Shell
- [x] **Main Application Framework**:
  - Main window shell with RTL support created
  - Navigation service implemented
  - Dependency injection container configured

### Models
- [x] **Member Entity Model**:
  - Core properties implemented (name, birth date, contact info, etc.)
  - Family relationship linking capability added
  
- [x] **User Entity Model**:
  - Username, password hash, role properties implemented

### Services
- [x] **User Service**:
  - Authentication functionality
  - Role-based authorization
  - Password management

- [x] **Member Service**:
  - CRUD operations
  - Search functionality
  - Family relationship management

- [x] **Subscription Service**:
  - Record monthly subscriptions
  - Handle advance payments
  - Calculate subscription status

## What's In Progress

### Models
- [ ] **Subscription Entity Model**:
  - Base properties defined
  - Need to complete advance payment support

- [ ] **Expense Entity Model**:
  - Initial structure defined
  - Need to implement all required properties

- [ ] **Application Settings Model**:
  - Structure planned
  - Implementation not yet started

### Repositories
- [ ] **Base Repository Pattern**:
  - Interface defined
  - Generic implementation in progress

- [ ] **Entity-Specific Repositories**:
  - Member repository partially implemented
  - Other repositories not yet started

### Services
- [ ] **Expense Service**:
  - Interface defined
  - Implementation not started

- [ ] **Report Service**:
  - Requirements defined
  - Implementation not started

### Configuration System
- [ ] **XML Configuration**:
  - Basic structure planned
  - Implementation not started

## What's Left To Build

### Data Persistence
- [ ] **Local Storage Implementation**:
  - Select and implement storage technology
  - Set up data migrations
  - Implement backup/restore functionality

### UI Components
- [ ] **Subscription Management UI**:
  - Payment recording interface
  - Subscription status view
  - Advance payment handling

- [ ] **Expense Management UI**:
  - Expense entry view
  - Expense categorization
  - Expense reporting

- [ ] **Reporting UI**:
  - Member status reports
  - Financial summaries
  - PDF export functionality

### Configuration & Settings
- [ ] **Settings Interface**:
  - Default subscription amount configuration
  - Backup settings
  - User preferences

## Current Status

The project is progressing with a focus on UI-first development utilizing mock services. The core infrastructure for Arabic language support and RTL layout is in place. Authentication, member management, and core navigation are functional with mock data.

The next major focus areas are:
1. Completing the remaining entity models
2. Implementing the repository layer for data persistence
3. Replacing mock services with actual implementations
4. Developing the remaining UI components

## Known Issues

1. **Data Persistence**: Not yet implemented, data is currently in-memory only.
2. **Model Completeness**: Some entity models still need refinement.
3. **UI Components**: Several planned views not yet implemented.

## Evolution Of Project Decisions

1. **Development Approach**:
   - Initially considered building backend first
   - Shifted to UI-first with mocked services for faster feedback

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Originally considered direct database access
   - Evolved to repository pattern for better abstraction

3. **Authentication**:
   - Started with simple authentication
   - May evolve to support more advanced security features
