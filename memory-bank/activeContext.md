# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Fixed build error in HomeViewModel.cs due to missing namespace for Resources
- Implemented a direct approach by using a hardcoded welcome message in Arabic
- Added the welcome message string to Resources.resx for future localization
- Successfully verified the build completes with no errors

## Recent Changes
- Fixed HomeViewModel.cs which had a constructor syntax error
- Removed dependency on Properties.Resources in HomeViewModel.cs
- Added WelcomeMessageDefault resource to Resources.resx

## Next Steps
- Implement proper resource loading for localization
- Set up proper resource generation in the project
- Verify UI rendering with the Arabic welcome message
- Continue implementing the planned features

## Decisions & Considerations
- For now, we've opted to use direct string initialization in the ViewModel instead of depending on resource files
- Will need to revisit resource handling for proper localization support
- Consider adding an ar-DZ.resx file for Arabic localization
